# samples/defdata
This sample use the ../env.shlib to determine the
registrar environment and check on the dxagent
It outputs the JSON data of the default DATA DSA.
It does so by calculating the the version of the dxagent
and pre-set dsa prefix.
The output can be used to for a base to create another data
that fits better for your need.
For example, the default dxgrid-db-size is set to a relatively small size.
You may want to change it to something that better fits your need.
